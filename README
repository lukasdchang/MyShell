# myshell
notes: 
    - interactive mode is when the input comes from a terminal, it will print
        welcome and good-bye messages and a prompt before reading the next command.
    - batch mode is when the user provides a script file containing commands to be executed.
    - use the similar tokenization algorithm we used in spell checker to read the input command lines

    Great video to see what exactly we are supposed to be making -> https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g?si=e1oOJF3oE9tsEzhr

Functions to include:
    - isatty() 
    - cd
    - pwd
    - which
    - exit

State of the code:
    - running with a script
        - for example: ./mysh myscript.sh
        - works so far
        - though the code does not continue prompting the user for more commands, it just ends. having trouble fixing this rn
    - ls
        - works
    - echo
        - works
    - concatinate
        - works
    - concatinate with piping 
        - for example: mysh> cat myscript.sh | ./mysh
        - the program goes batshit crazy
    - exit
        - works
        - though it does not print the goodbye message
    - cd
        - looks like it works though idk how to display what the current directory it is on
    - have not tested anything else
