notes: 
    - interactive mode is when the input comes from a terminal, it will print
        welcome and good-bye messages and a prompt before reading the next command.
    - batch mode is when the user provides a script file containing commands to be executed.
    - use the similar tokenization algorithm we used in spell checker to read the input command lines

    Great video to see what exactly we are supposed to be making -> https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g?si=e1oOJF3oE9tsEzhr


State of the code:
    - reading the command
        - tokenizing
            - works
        - wildcards
            - works
        - redirection
            - works 
            - fix formatting 
            - for example:
                - mysh> cat < test1.txt
                  this is content from test1.txtmysh> 
        - pipelines
            - does not work
        - conditionals
            - does not work

    - running with a script
        - works
    - ls
        - works
    - echo
        - works
    - cat
        - works
    - exit
        - works
        - "Additionally, exit should print any arguments it receives, separated by spaces."
            - not sure if it does that
    - cd
        - basic functionality
            - works
        - pathnames (/)
            - works
        - bare names
            - need to test on iLab
    - pwd
        - works
    - which
        - works

    How to run: 
        make 
            compiles the code
        make clean 
            deletes compile file and empties test2.txt
