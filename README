# myshell
notes: 
    - interactive mode is when the input comes from a terminal, it will print
        welcome and good-bye messages and a prompt before reading the next command.
    - batch mode is when the user provides a script file containing commands to be executed.
    - use the similar tokenization algorithm we used in spell checker to read the input command lines
