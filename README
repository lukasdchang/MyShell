Design Notes:
    - tokenize_command() drew inspiration from previous project, Spell Checker, to implement tokenization of the command aruments.
        - uses strtok() to tokenize each command and puts each one into an args[] array.
    - we decided we wanted to put main at the top instead of the bottom as we usually have done in the past because it made the 
        code easier to understand since it was chronological.
        - because we made this choice, we had to use function prototypes above the main
    - one issue we were runnning into was the formatting for when the cat command is called by the user. when cat was called, 
        the output would not print out a new line. 

Testing:
    - tokenizing
        
    - Wildcards
        
    - Redirection
        
    - Pipelines
        
    - Conditionals
        
    - Running with script (Batch mode)
        
    - exit
        
    - cd
        
    - pwd
        
    - which
        
    - tokenizing
        
    - tokenizing
        
    - tokenizing
        

State of the code:
    - reading the command
        - tokenizing
            - works
        - wildcards
            - works
        - redirection
            - works 
        - pipelines
            - works
        - conditionals
            - works

    - running with a script
        - works
    - ls
        - works
    - echo
        - works
    - cat
        - works
    - exit
        - works
        - "Additionally, exit should print any arguments it receives, separated by spaces."
            - not sure if it does that
    - cd
        - basic functionality
            - works
        - pathnames (/)
            - works
        - bare names
            - need to test on iLab
    - pwd
        - works
    - which
        - works

    How to run: 
        make 
            compiles the code
        make clean 
            deletes compile file and empties test2.txt
